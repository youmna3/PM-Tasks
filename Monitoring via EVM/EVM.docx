Time Frame 13 m
project started 7 m ago 

1- By how much it's over/under budget?

    preparation D=2M    budget = 600K  AC = 600K 100%
    Design      D=3M    budget = 1200  AC = 1400K (OVER BUDGET BY 200K) 100%
    Imp         D=2M    budget = 400   AC = 200K  50%
    Testing     D=3M    budget = 1200  AC = 500K (OVER BUDGET BY 100K) 33.3%
    Deployment  D=3M    budget = 300   AC = 0 0%

- we are over buget by 200k from design and 100K from Testing
over budget by 300k


2- By how many days it's ahead/behind schedule?

    ∵ The project started 7 M ago
    ∵ only 50% of the Implemention is done in 2M duration 
    ∵ 33.33% of the Testing is done in the 7th month 
    ∴ the Project is behind schedule by 20 days or 1 month as the testing depends on the implementation (Estimation: an extra 2 months will be needed for the implementation task to be done)

3- By the end of the project, by how much will it be over/under buget?

    ∵ Desing task is over budget by 200K
    ∵ Testing task is over budget by 100K in one month
    ∵ only 50% is done in the implementation's duration (maybe an extra employees will be needed)
    ∴ The project will be over budget by +500K


Formula:

CV:     Cost variance
EV:     Earned Value
AC:     Actual Value
BAC:    Budget at completion (agreed-upon or approved total spending for the project) (3,700)
SV:     Schedule Variance (SV equals the difference between your project’s earned value and planned value)
PV:     Planned value (any work scheduled to be completed)
cpi:    Cost Performance Index
SPI:    schedule performance index (measure of the conformance of actual progress)
EAC:    Estimate at Completion is the current expectation
After 7 months
1- Cost variance: CV = EV – AC (difference between earned value and actual costs)
    
    Ac = 600+1400+200+500 = 2,700K 
    EV = Percent complete (actual) x Task Budget 
                 = (% completed work) * (BAC)
                 = 600+1400+(0.5x400)+(0.33*1200) 
                 = 2,600K
    CV = EV – AC
       = 2600 - 2700
       = -100K


2- Schedule Variance: SV = EV – PV
    PV = (% scheduled work) * (BAC)
       = 3*2,200
       =6600
       
    SV = EV – PV
       = 2,600-400
       = 2200K

3- cpi:earned value (EV) / actual cost (AC)
    cpi = EV/AC
        = 2600/2700
        = 0.96
        >1 project is over budget

4- SPI:
    SPI = EV / PV
        = 2600/6600
        = 0.4
        less than 1.0 indicates poorer-than-planned project
        
5- EAC = BAC/cpi
        =2200/0.96
        =2,291.6
